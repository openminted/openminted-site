Welcome to the OpenMinTeD Resources.

OpenMinted sets out to create an open, service-oriented ep-Infrastructure for Text and Data Mining 
(TDM) of scientific and scholarly content. Researchers can collaboratively create, discover, share 
and re-use Knowledge from a wide range of text-based scientific related sources in a seamless way.

This page provides access to several resources created with the project, mainly relating to

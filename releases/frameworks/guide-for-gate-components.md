##Guide for GATE components



For the current release of GATE \(which doesn't use Maven for plugin building/distribution\), there is a set of detailed slides and hands-on materials from our training course, that walk you through the steps of building a new plugin:

* slides: [https://gate.ac.uk/sale/talks/gate-course-jun16/module-5-developers/2-creole-writing/2-creole-writing.pdf](https://gate.ac.uk/sale/talks/gate-course-jun16/module-5-developers/2-creole-writing/2-creole-writing.pdf)

* hands-on materials: [http://gate.ac.uk/sale/talks/gate-course-jun16/module-5-developers/2-creole-writing/2-creole-writing-hands-on.zip](http://gate.ac.uk/sale/talks/gate-course-jun16/module-5-developers/2-creole-writing/2-creole-writing-hands-on.zip)

Details of GATE descriptors can be found at [https://gate.ac.uk/userguide/sec:creole-model:config](https://gate.ac.uk/userguide/sec:creole-model:config) although they do not currently contain much of the information needed to complete the OMTD-SHARE metadata descriptor. Note that this is changing to include more OpenMinTed like information much of which will be specified in a Maven POM rather than as CREOLE metadata. This is currently not documented as it relates to the next version of GATE that is still under active development.

An update with documentation on how to use Maven to build and distribute a new plugin will soon be released.
